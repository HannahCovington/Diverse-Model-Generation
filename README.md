If you are only interested in:

       -Using the program as-is: you only need to download ModelGenerator.zip
     
       -Modifying the input data and/or the source code: you will need to download DeveloperTools.zip and SourceCode.zip


In order to run the application, you will need to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. In order to simulate the output model files, EnergyPlus v9.4 must be installed.

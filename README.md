# Diverse-Model-Generation
This application stochastically creates EnergyPlus residential models which realistically exhibit characteristics of households within particular income levels and US climate zones. 



If you are interested in:

-Using the program as-is: you only need to download ModelGenerator.zip
     
-Modifying the input data and/or the source code: you will need to download DeveloperTools.zip and SourceCode.zip



In order to run the application, you will need to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. In order to simulate the output model files, EnergyPlus v9.4 must be installed. 



Tutorials covering how to set up, use, and modify the program are available here:
